# Hydrator mod for Wurm Unlimited (Server)

Requires [Ago's Server Mod Launcher](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher/releases) to run.

This mod is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

The mod disables the dehydration logic of the game. The players will never be thirsty anymore. If the hydration bar should be reduced on login, the player can simply go to a water source (like a lake) and drink. Once refilled, the bar will permanently stay at the maximum lvl.
